# Ciphers

Transopition (T) </br>
Reverse (R) </br>
Caesar (C) </br>

With the Caesar cipher you can choose what alphabets you would like to encode in. When the option "alphabetic key" appears you can type 0, 1, 2 and or 3 these each corespond to an alphabet; type "0123" for maximum encryption security, this makes use of all of the alphabets.

> [!TIP]
> The ideal key is around half of your message's length, as longer keys than that may result in text being more understandable!
